# Orobanche Seed Counter

[Link](https://yehuda-yu-aleket-count-seeds-app-aleket-streamlit-pnu1sd.streamlit.app/)

This app is designed to count Orobanche ("Aleket") seeds that have germinated within a image.
Orobanche received different biological treatments that affect the amount of seeds germinated. The app uses image processing and AI to separate background, count seeds and identify how many of them have germinated.

## Usage
Upload an image of the Orobanche seeds to the app.
Wait for the app to process the photo.
The app will display the photo with the background removed and the seeds identified and counted.
The app will also display the number of seeds that have germinated.
